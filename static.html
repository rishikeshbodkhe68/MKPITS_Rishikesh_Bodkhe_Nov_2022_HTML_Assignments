<p>n contrast to the natural environment is the built environment. Built environments are where humans have fundamentally transformed landscapes 
such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion, the natural environment is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. 
Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, the modified environment becomes an artificial one. 
Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence beaver dams, and the works of mound-building termites,
 are thought of as natural.</p>

<p>People cannot find absolutely natural environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% 
natural in the other. The massive environmental changes of humanity in the Anthropocene have fundamentally effected all natural environments:
 including from climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution from plastic and other chemicals in the air and water. More precisely, we can
 consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform.</p>

<p>If,
 for instance, in an agricultural field, the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, 
but the structure is quite different.</p>
